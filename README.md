# Installation

No installation. Download it, put it in a folder wherever you want, done. I insist on putting it in a folder because it'll create a file next to it.

# Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.5.2

# Usage

- Wait for it to prompt you to connect
- Connect on the website on the browser in EHWVB
