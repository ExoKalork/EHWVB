# Installation

No installation. Download it, put it in a folder wherever you want, done. I insist on putting it in a folder because it'll create a file next to it.

# Requirements

- Windows 7 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.5.2
- A brain

# Usage

- Open EHWVB
- Wait for it to prompt you to connect
- Connect on the website on the browser in EHWVB
- Click enable
- Enjoy ! (You can minimize the application, it'll stay in the taskbar.)

# TODO

- Remember position and scale
- About menu
- Multiple accounts
- Refresh Page button
- Check if user is online before voting because random disconnecting can apparently happen. (website's fault)
